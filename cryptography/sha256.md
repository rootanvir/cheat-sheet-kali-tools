# SHA-256 for File Integrity and Change Detection

SHA-256 is commonly used to verify the integrity of files and detect any changes. By generating a hash of a file's content, you can later compare the hash to detect if the file has been altered.

## How It Works:
1. **File Hashing**: When the file is initially created or received, a SHA-256 hash is generated from the file's content. This hash represents the unique "fingerprint" of the file.
2. **Storing the Hash**: The hash value is securely stored or transmitted along with the file, but it should be kept in a location where it cannot be tampered with.
3. **Future Checks**: At a later time, the SHA-256 hash of the file is re-calculated. If the file's content has been altered in any way, the new hash will differ from the original hash.
4. **Comparison**: By comparing the newly generated hash with the stored hash, you can confirm whether the file has remained unchanged or been tampered with.

## Example Process:

1. **Generate the Initial Hash**:
   - Calculate the SHA-256 hash of the file when it is first created or received. This hash is the baseline for future integrity checks.
   
   Example:
   ```bash
   sha256sum examplefile.txt
   ```
2. **If anything changed we can detect that by checking sha256 sum value**
