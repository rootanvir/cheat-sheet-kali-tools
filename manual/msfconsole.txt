MSFCONSOLE(1)               Metasploit Framework Console               MSFCONSOLE(1)

NAME
       msfconsole - Metasploit Framework Console

SYNOPSIS
       msfconsole [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Msfconsole  is probably the most popular interface to the MSF. It provides an
       "all-in-one" centralized console and allows you efficient access to virtually
       all of the options available in the Metasploit Framework. Msfconsole may seem
       intimidating at first, but once you learn the syntax of the commands you will
       learn to appreciate the power of utilizing this interface.
